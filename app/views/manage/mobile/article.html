        <p>If you do not know the original phone number on your account you can get us to email you a security code to verify your account.</p>

        <p>When attempting to change your phone number, you will need access to a working mobile phone with a signal. This will take you a few minutes to complete, but for security purposes the change will take 24 hours to update on your account.</p>
 
        <p>During this 24 hour period, you will only be able to access your account using your old mobile phone number if you still have access to it.</p>

        <p>To cancel the update to your phone number, you must select the confirmation link we send you. If the link does not work, there are a number of possible reasons why.</p>

        <h3>Expired link – Reference CID3002</h3>

        <p>The link expires 24 hours after we email it to you.</p>
        <p>We may have already updated the phone number you use to log in. In this case you would have received a confirmation email.</p>
        <p>You can check or change your login and security settings in <a href="#">your NHS account</a>.</p>
